### Scene 11

This file is just a note. You can save notes anywhere you like in the project tree. Notes can be filtered out when you export the project.

In root folders that isnâ€™t the Novel root folder, you can _only_ add notes. In the Novel root folder, you can choose between a number of layouts. Some of them are just to let yourself know what each file is for.
