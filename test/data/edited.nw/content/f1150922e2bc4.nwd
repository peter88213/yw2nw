Adding more scenes to a chapter is as easy as adding more scene files, with a level three heading, or just adding another level three heading in the same file if that works for the way you want to structure your files.

In fact, if you wish, you can add all the scenes in the chapter file too. All novelWriter cares about is the level of the headings.
