% synopsis: How to align text.


The text by default will have the left or justified alignment in the main text files in your project. You can also specify alignment for a specific paragraph by “pushing” it away from an edge with a set of ‘>>’ or ‘<<’ symbols, like so:

This text is left-aligned. <<

>> This text is right-aligned.

>> This text is centred. <<
