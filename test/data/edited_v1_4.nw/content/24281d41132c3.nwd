### Scene 11



This file is just a note. You can save notes anywhere you like in the project tree. Notes can be filtered out when you export the project.

In root folders that isn’t the Novel root folder, you can _only_ add notes. In the Novel root folder, you can choose between a number of layouts. Some of them are just to let yourself know what each file is for.
