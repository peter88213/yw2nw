### Scene 13



The folders in the tree view have no structural meaning other than theyâ€™re a way for you to organise your files into groups in whatever way suits you. They are not intended to represent chapters, but you can of course use them for that. If you do, know that you still need to define chapter headers in your structure so novelWriter knows where you want them.
