## Important

Please note that the program has not yet been extensively tested. To me, it's actually just a proof of concept. I probably won't develop the program further. Feel free to copy the project and modify it to your own liking.

### Conventions

Exceptions:
- No localization is required.
- The directory structure is modified to minimize dependencies.

- [Eclipse IDE](https://eclipse.org) with [PyDev](https://pydev.org) and [EGit](https://www.eclipse.org/egit/)
